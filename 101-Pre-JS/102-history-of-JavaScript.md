## History of JavaScript 

## 1995
Brendan Eich creates the very first version of JavaScript in just 10 days. It was called
Mocha, but already had many fundamental features of modern JavaScript

## 1996
Mocha changes to LiveScript and then to JavaScript, in order to attract Java developers.
However, JavaScript has almost nothing to do with Java

## 1997
With a need to standardize the language, ECMA releases ECMAScript 1 (ES1), the first official
standard for JavaScript (ECMAScript is the standard, JavaScript the language in practice)

## 2009
ES5 (ECMAScript 5) is released with lots of great new features

## 2015
ES6/ES2015 (ECMAScript 2015) was released: the biggest update to the language ever. ECMAScript changes to an annual release cycle in order to ship less features per update
