## JavaScript Operators

* Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, **, %, ++, --)
* Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=)
* Comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=)
    * Ternary operator (?)
* Logical operator (&&, ||, !)
* Spread operator (...)
* Type operator
* Bitwise Operator

## Terms 
* Operator precedence
* String Comparison
* Logical And (&&), Logical OR (||)
* The AND operator (&&) has a higher precedence than the OR (||) operator, meaning the && operator is executed before the || operator
